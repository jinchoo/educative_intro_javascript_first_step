//Numbers, Strings & Booleans

//Numbers
//Numbers are expamles of 19, 30, 94234511

//Strings
//We can think of strings as the way we represent text in JavaScript.  They're created using the ' and " characters.

//Example:

let string = 'Hello'
let string2 = 'Hello'

//Deciding whether to use ' or " is based on personal prefernce.  We just can't mix them up when creating a string.

//String Characters

//String do'nt have to be words.  We can put any typedable keybard character into a string.  We can also put pretty much any text you can find the internect into a string.  Even Emojis.

let lettersAndNumbers = 'abcd1234'
let symbols = '!@#$%^&*()'
let emojis = '😀😂😃😄😅😆😉😊😋😌😍😎😏😒😓😔😖😘😚😜😝😞😠😡😢😣'

//Escaping Characters

//What happens if we want to use ' or " characters in our string?  We can escape, put a \ in front of them.  This means that JavaScript will interpret them as normal string characters and won't end the string.

console.log("I'm a string")

//Booleans

//A third basic type of variable is callled a boolean.  Boleans contain 1 of 2 possible values: true or false.

let booleanTrue = true
let booleanFalse = false

//true and false are reserved keywords in JavaScript.  Because of this, they can't be used as varialbe names.

//Naming Variables

//We always want to give our variables descriptive names.
//The code logic gets quite confusing and poorly named variables can make it impossibe to read our own code.
//Descriptive variable names are vital.
